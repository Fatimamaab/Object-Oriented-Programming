# Object-Oriented-Programming

Welcome to the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) repository! This project showcases key principles of OOP through clear examples, exercises, and practical applications using Python.

This repository contains examples, assignments, and mini-projects that demonstrate the four core pillars of object-oriented programming:

* Encapsulation:
        Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction through methods.

* Inheritance:
        Creating new classes based on existing ones to promote code reuse.

* Polymorphism:
        Defining different behaviors for the same interface or method.

* Abstraction:
        Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.

Whether you're a beginner or revisiting OOP concepts, this repo is designed to help you understand and apply OOP in real-world scenarios.
